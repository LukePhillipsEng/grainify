### Grainify 1 2025, Luke Phillips ###
// User inputs microstructure grain map and material and program estimates average grain diameter and yield strength through Hall Petch constants
Python, Flask, HTML, JSON(Java) css, written with the help of some prompt engineering for front end Java

V 1.01
-Basic yield strength for short materials list
Feature(s) to add: Improved materials list, major debugging overhaul, better download features

End goal is to trace and accurately categorize large dataset of material grain maps to feed into ML for predictive generation and grain analysis. 
Looking for grain photos!
